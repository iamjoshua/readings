3/4/2018,The Moral Landscape,Sam Harris,Nonfiction,Science,4.6,"I absolutely love the premise of this book and it's unfortunate that this book even needed to be written as it feels like common sense to me. This also made it somewhat dissapointing as I wish he would have made an attempt to define some kind of framework. But, to be fair, that would have been outside of the scope of text which primarily focuses on arguing for the concept of a science of morality. "
2/20/2018,Mastering Logical Fallacies,Michael Withey,Nonfiction,Philosophy,4,"I enjoyed the format of the book and thought it worked well for the subject matter. It was a great general introduction to various logical fallacies, but it did leave me wanting more depth at points, but that is to be expected with general guides like this. I also thought that many of the fallacies were just specific versions of other more general fallacies. This was fine, but it did point to a need for categories or classes of fallacies and not just an alphabetical list."
2/18/2018,Waking Up,Sam Harris,Nonfiction,Philosophy,4.5,I gained some needed validation from this book. I've missed my meditation practice from years ago when I was religious. Sam has explored deeply this merging of practice with reason that my mind has been returning to lately.
2/8/2018,The Little Prince,Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,Fiction,Children,2,"I am told this is a beloved classic. I can't say that I liked it. Granted it's for children, but when compared to another classic like Charolette's Web which I thought was very well done, it's lacking. There were some moments of beauty like how becoming tamed means finding something more beautiful than before, but then the implied duality of spirit and body seemed forced. Even the Alchemist which was strongly spiritual was easy to look past in this regard because of a deeper more practical life message. "
1/26/2018,Lincoln in the Bardo,George Saunders,Fiction,"Novel, experimental",2.5,this is a tough one to review. It took me a long time to get into the experimental style. It’s definitely unique. But towards the end I was engaged and the reading flowed. Still I don’t think that I’ll look back fondly on this one. It only felt like Saunders from time to time.
1/14/2018,Are Numbers Real?,Brian Clegg,Nonfiction,Math,2,"I've been interested in the question for a few years. I found the first half of the book very interesting, but the second half (or so) seemed to explore specific domains too much. There was a whole section just on general relativity that, while interesting, didn't directly contribute to the topic. I can't remember when I started this book exactly, but I put it down for several months before finally finishing it today. It could have been half as long and twice as good."
1/11/2018,Artemis,Andy Weir,Fiction,Science Fiction,3.9,"I enjoyed it. It wasn't a masterpiece of literature. I wasn't a fan of the teenage girl attitude (even though she wasn't a teenager) of the main character, but it didn't ruin the story for me either. It was fun and I appreciated the detail and accuracy of the scientific aspects of the book. It was a fun ride, but probably one I wont remember for long. "
1/4/2018,Free Will,Sam Harris,Nonfiction,Philosophy,4.5,"A very well written argument against the concept of Free Will. It was short, but took me a while to read because of the constant argument it triggered in my mind. I think there is a lot that he is wrong about in regards to consciousness but at the same time I think he's right about his conclusions. I kept thinking of an essay to refute his conclusion, but I found that it kept relying on mechanistic explanations and didn't address his ultimate point that the idea of free will is self contradictory. I can't disagree with that, though I do disagree with his method to reaching that conclusion. It gave me a lot to think about and for that I like this book. I'll most likely reread it again as my work on consciousness progresses further. "
12/28/2017,CivilWarland In Bad Decline,George Saunders,Fiction,short stories,4,"God I love this guy. He makes me laugh and then (almost) cry. While not as ""good"" as 10th of Dec, it was still great. "
11/29/2017,Turtles all the Way Down,John Green,Fiction ,YA,3.5,"It was an enjoyable read, but not nearly as good as A Fault in Our Stars. It was interesting, though, to get an inside look into OCD."
10/5/2017,A Farewell to Arms,Ernest Hemingway,Fiction,War,4,I love the brevity of his writing. There was a clear narrative plot unlike Sun also Rises which I appreciated. I was saddened by the ending but I knew it was coming. There were a few passages through the book that blew me away. Such clarity in his writing.  
9/8/2017,Pastoralia,George Saunders,Fiction,short stories,4,"He's such a good author—funny but thoughtful. I didn't like this one as much as 10th of Dec, but it was still very enjoyable. "
8/24/2017,Childhood's End,Arthur C. Clarke,Fiction,Science Fiction,4,"Some of the concepts felt lazy or rushed to get to some greater point—like man not realizing that it needed a purpose. But overall I enjoyed the ride. It did give me things to think about, but nothing too deep. Because of its age, there were concepts like the paranormal that seemed possible, which could be modernized to reflect something more accurate without losing the underlying point. It left me wanting to read more of Clarke's work."
8/21/2017,Antifragile,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Nonfiction,Systems,5,"Another amazing book by Taleb. I love that guy. This one was better than the Black Swan. I learned a lot and changed the way that I think about not trying to predict outcomes, but finding weaknesses to improve or remove instead. "
8/18/2017,A Man for All Markets,Edward O. Thorp,Nonfiction,Finance,4.5,I enjoyed the read. I found it motivating. I read his first book Beat the Dealer years ago when I wasn interesting in blackjack. It's interesting to note that I ended up interested in finance just as he did. I liked how he thought through the years. 
7/20/2017,How Emotions Are Made,Lisa Feldman Barrett,Nonfiction,Cognition,5,I've been scooped. It was like reading a book that I wrote. She explained the theory that I've been working on since I started this AI work. At first I was pissed but then I was just happy for the validation. Such a good book. She nailed it. 
7/10/2017,The Bed of Procrustes,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Nonfiction,Philosophy,3.9,"I used to love aphorisms, but as I've learned how ambiguous language can be, I've lost that love. I prefer longer form writing now. Maybe this is a phse too. I still enjoyed the thoughts in this book. I'll reread it again in the future as it's contents are best consumed as fragments over time and thoroughly digested."
6/27/2017,"Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.",Ron Chernow,Nonfiction,Biography,0,
6/27/2017,Ego is the Enemy,Ryan Holiday,Nonfiction,Philosophy,3.5,"It was enjoyable but it often felt very generic—almost self 'helpy'. I liked the subject matter but it seems like he would assume too much at times. So while one statement would be based on logic the next would assume something without any grounds for doing so. For instance, he wraps up the book with a section on love which is too abstract for a concrete stoic philosophy inspired book. A better term like gratitude should have been picked or a specific concept like a sense of connectedness. To just say ""love"" felt like he was pulling from a canned and assumed shared belief system which didn't resonate with the topic at hand at all. "
6/27/2017,Intelligence: A Very Short Introduction,Ian Deary,Nonfiction,Science,4,"It wasn't what I expected. I thought it would explore intelligence itself but it was all about human testing of intelligence. However, I really enjoyed the topic and learned a few things."
6/22/2017,The Genius of Birds,Jennifer Ackerman,Nonfiction,Biology/Cognition,4,"A very well written book. It ded feel repetative at times and the most ineteresting aspects to me were about bird cognition but these parts were the skimpiest. Still though, I enjoyed the read."
6/18/2017,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,James Joyce,Fiction,Novel,2,I really wanted to like this book. I definitely did not. There was so much religions stuff that just droned on. I liked the later sections where he is thinking things through for himself. I with the whole book was like that. To just have 20-30 page chuncks of sermon after sermon was brutal to read. It might be a while if ever I try to read another Joyce novel.
6/4/2017,Other Minds,Peter Godfrey-Smith,Nonfiction,Biology/Philosophy,4,"An enjoyable read. I liked the exploration of intelligence, but found the philosophical parts unfocused and detached from the more scientific aspects. The last chapter completely abandoned the topic of the book and discussed oncean conservation which is a worthy topic, but just not the one of the book."
5/25/2017,Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?,Frans de Waal,Nonfiction,Biology,4,"This was an interesting book and I really enjoyed the subject matter but it never really delved deeper than surface level mentions of studies. i wanted more details note more general examples. I suppose it served his purpose of simply convincing people that animals have cognition as we do, but I've always thought that. I was interested in more details on intelligence, not whether animals have any! Still though, I enjoyed the read."
5/17/2017,Kite Runner,Khaled Hosseini,Fiction,Historical Fiction,3,"I'm glad it's over. I really enjoyed the first part of the book but then it just dragged me throught the mud. I suppose exposure to the perspective of the story was good but it was more of a lesson on how shitty life in parts of the world could be than entertainment. But mostly the writing was just shit. Constant heavy handed foreshadowing, odd sentence sctructure... eh, I really wanted to like the book after getting attached to the characters early on, but the book just spiraled out of control."
5/11/2017,Tenth of December,George Saunders,Fiction,short stories,5,"Amazing writer. He is now one of my favorites. Each story had its strengths but something about ""Sticks"" stuck with me. It's brevity, wit, and impact were so impactful."
5/10/2017,The Black Swan,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Nonfiction,uncertainty,5,Amazing. One of the best books I've ever read. I should read again; and again; and again.
4/22/2017,Gratitude,Oliver Sacks,Nonfiction,autobiography,5,He was a great writer. I enjoyed the subject matter and his style. I've been wanting to read one of his books for a while. This was a nice introduction to his writing even if it was the last of it.
4/21/2017,Armada,Ernest Cline,Fiction,Science Fiction,4,"I really enjoyed reading this. It wasn't horribly written but it wasn't a literary masterpiece to say the least. Like with his first book, I found the subject matter itself provided enough enjoyment to overshadow the often subpar prose. "
4/11/2017,Player Piano,Vonnegut ,Fiction,Science Fiction,2,I really did not enjoy this one. I thought for sure I would have since the topic (automation/mechanization/AI) is my main interest. It just was boring to me though. It was his first book and it really showed. It killed my love of reading for a while there. 
2/18/2017,Fooled by Randomness,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Nonfiction,Economics,5,I loved this book. I learned so much.
2/9/2017,The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,Alice Schroeder,Nonfiction,Biography,4,"I really enjoyed learning about Buffett, primarly his early years. It was very long and detailed though.The later years focused too much on specific deals he made which I suppose were important for context, but weren't that educational or entertaining. "
2/5/2017,Flash Boys,Michael Lewis,Nonfiction,Finance,4,"I've always heard that Lewis was a good author. He definitely is. This book was very well written and informative. It felt repetitive at points, though I understand the need since the average reader would have a hard time grasping the concept of latency and how it enables arbitrage. "
1/31/2017,Stock Market Investing For Beginners,Tycho Press,Nonfiction,Investing,4,Short but detailed. A good reference to keep around as well.
1/28/2017,Stock Market 101,Michele Cagan,Nonfiction,Investing,4,"It was an enjoyable, light, introduction to various aspects of the market. "
1/21/2017,Darkness at Noon,Arthur Koestler,Fiction,Dystopia,3.5,"It was well written and thought provoking, but I didn't enjoy the ride. It was a lesson on the logical errors inherent to comunism—which I'm glad I read."
1/17/2017,"Emergence: The connected lives of ants, brains, cities, and software",Steven Johnson,Nonfiction,Science,2,"This was a real slog. The author had a tenuous grasp on complexity theory and seemed to miss just how significant emergence is. His examples were horribly uninteresting. At times he just rambles on about things that seem unimportant. I couldn't imagine reading a more boring book on a more interesting subject. The only joy I felt from this book was from the accomplishment of getting through it. There were a few thoughts that the book provoked in passing, which is the only reason why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1."
