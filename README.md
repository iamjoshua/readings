Things I've read

## July 11th, 2025 - Data Consolidation

Today I consolidated all my reading data from multiple sources into a single, unified CSV file:

### What I accomplished:
- **Merged philosophy papers**: Combined two CSV files containing 47 philosophy papers, removing duplicates and cleaning up inconsistencies
- **Added archived books**: Integrated 152 books from my historical archive (2008-2018) with ratings and reviews
- **Unified current readings**: Included my current reading list from readings.md (2023-2025)
- **Data cleaning**: Fixed formatting issues, standardized categories, corrected placeholder ratings
- **Created master file**: Final `readings.csv` contains 209 total entries with consistent structure

### File structure:
- `readings.csv` - My reading history (books and papers)
- `philosophy_papers.csv` - Clean philosophy papers dataset
- `books archive.csv` - Historical book archive (cleaned)
- `readings.md` - Extended markdown version with all entries

### Notes:
There are quite a few more philosophy papers that I need to add to the list, but I can't currently find the old spreadsheet and I stopped tracking the papers in my vault a long time ago. I'll need to manually enter them to catch up on the missing entries.
